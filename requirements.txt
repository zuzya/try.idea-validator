# Vector DB (If needed for local Chroma, but check if we can skip)
# chromadb was causing issues and we might rely on Google embeddings + local JSON.
# However, if langgraph or other tools imply it, we might need it. 
# Given previous error was about chromadb dependency, let's omit it if possible 
# and see if it builds. The user's code 'google_recruiter.py' uses pure numpy for vector search.
# So we DO NOT need chromadb.
